	    <h3>Using the Application</h3>
	    <p>This GIS <b>Citizen Comment Collector</b> web application allows citizens to submit their comments, requests and ideas for different Civiltech projects. It is a single application that can be used on a desktop browser, mobile phone, and tablet device. In short, the comment collector application allows citizens to submit comments to a specific project study area. Pan and zoom around, click/tap directly on the map to pin your comment to the map. Then, provide details about your comment and click/tap 'Submit' to finalize your request. Providing your name, phone and/or email is OPTIONAL. This information will be seen by Civiltech Engineers and will NOT be available to other users.</p>

If you accidentally place a comment marker in the wrong location, you can "cancel" the placement and replace the marker again.
